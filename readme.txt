Hello user, this is a simple Python text/terminal calculator used in helping new comers learn simple programming with Python.

The code utilizes python 3.2, but should work with 3.3 just as easily.

You can find support for this code over at www.essenceofzen.tk

Thank you for using my program, I'll continue developing it as I go. Future plans include porting it over to different langauges for learning
purposes as well as eventually making a GUI.

All over our programs will later include a console debug feature that will allow the user to check everything, gain root access to the program, and ensure proper use.
